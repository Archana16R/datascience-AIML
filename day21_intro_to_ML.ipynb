    "Machine Learning is a method of teaching computers to learn patterns from data instead of explicitly programming every rule. In traditional programming, we provide the computer with input data and fixed rules, and it produces an output. However, in Machine Learning, we provide the computer with input data along with the correct outputs (answers), and the system learns the underlying rules or patterns by itself. Once trained, the model can use those learned patterns to make predictions on new, unseen data. In simple terms, instead of writing rules manually, we allow the computer to discover the rules from data."
